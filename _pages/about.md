Hello! I am a first year PhD Student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu) at the University of Washington. I obtained my MS in the department in 2019.

I am passionate about learning a new method or concept and then teaching it to others, whether it be in (bio)statistics, epidemiology, or programming and software development. I enjoy translating statistical models into flexible software applications, using both Python and R, with a special focus on designing efficient workflows for those applications using high performance computing.

My current research focuses on developing methods and software tools for population health modeling that make use of all available data with [Sasha Aravkin](https://uw-amo.github.io/saravkin/). For my MS thesis under the guidance of my advisor [Ruth Etzioni](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/etzioni-ruth.html), I developed a method to estimate time to cancer progression or recurrence using population level data from cancer registries.

I was also a Post-Bachelor Fellow and a Researcher at IHME where I worked on a variety of statistical modeling projects for the [Global Burden of Disease Study](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd) and contributed to training GBD collaborators from around the world and new Fellows in statistical and epidemiological methods as well as computing.

During undergrad, I worked on a variety of research projects at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://www.fhcrc.org) in Biostatistics with [Jim Hughes](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/james-hughes) and in Epidemiology with [Beth Mueller](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/mueller-beth.html). In 2016, I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Science in Public Health and a minor in Math. Go Dawgs!
