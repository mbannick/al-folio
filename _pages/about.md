Hello! I am a third-year PhD Student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu) at the University of Washington.

*What do I work on?*

My research interests include the design and analysis of clinical trials, statistical learning, and population health. I am co-advised by [Dr. Noah Simon](http://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/) and [Dr. Ting Ye](https://sites.google.com/view/tingye). Our current research is on inconsistent covariate adjustment in group sequential trials and covariate adjustment in trials with covariate-adaptive randomization.

I am also a Research Assistant with [Dr. Fei Gao](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/gao-fei.html) in the [Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Epidemiology Program](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division/research/biostatistics-bioinformatics-and-epidemiology.html) at [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center](http://www.fhcrc.org). We are working on statistical methods for estimating cross-sectional HIV incidence, which are useful for population effectiveness studies, and for obtaining counterfactual placebo incidence in active-controlled trials (see our recent paper in [Statistics in Medicine](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.9296)). We also have recent work discussing study designs of retrospective, observational studies of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

*How did I get here?*

Previously I was a Post-Bachelor Fellow and a Researcher on the Mathematical Sciences team at IHME where I worked on a variety of disease modeling projects for the [Global Burden of Disease Study](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd). I also helped train GBD collaborators from around the world and new Fellows in computing, and statistical and epidemiological methods. During my fellowship, I obtained my MS in Biostatistics, advised by [Dr. Ruth Etzioni](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/etzioni-ruth.html) on methods to estimate time to cancer progression or recurrence.
