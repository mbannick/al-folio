Hello! I am a PhD Student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu) at the University of Washington.

My research interests include the design and analysis of clinical trials, statistical learning, and population health metrics. Currently, I am a Research Assistant with [Dr. Fei Gao](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/gao-fei.html) at [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://www.fhcrc.org) where we are working on statistical methods for estimating counterfactual placebo incidence of HIV for active-controlled trials in HIV prevention.

Previously I was a Post-Bachelor Fellow and a Researcher on the Mathematical Sciences team at IHME where I worked on a variety of disease modeling projects for the [Global Burden of Disease Study](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd) and contributed to training GBD collaborators from around the world and new Fellows in statistical and epidemiological methods as well as computing.

I obtained my MS in Biostatistics in 2019. For my master's thesis I worked with [Dr. Ruth Etzioni](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/etzioni-ruth.html) on methods to estimate time to cancer progression or recurrence using population level data from cancer registries.

In 2016, I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Science in Public Health and a minor in Math. During undergrad, I worked on a variety of research projects at Fred Hutch in Biostatistics with [Dr. Jim Hughes](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/james-hughes) and in Epidemiology with [Dr. Beth Mueller](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/mueller-beth.html).
